# Ponder
Ponder is an app which allows the user to write journal entries about whatever they're grateful for. This prompted self reflection is meant to have the user try to stay optimistic and see the bright side of whatever situation they may be in. It also provides inspiring quotes and stories for the user to read, which can hopefully motivate the user in some way to self-improve. Lastly, there is also a to-do list function, which is meant to help keep the user on task and focused, and allow them to finish whatever work they may need to do before they fall behind and create more stress for themselves.
